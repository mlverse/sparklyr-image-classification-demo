Description: This package is a sparklyr extension containing all required MVN
    dependencies and train+test data sets for a Sparklyr image classification
    demo. The goal of this demo is to leverage Apache Spark and Inception V3
    (a pre-trained convolutional neural network for image analysis tasks) to
    build a scalable ML pipeline capable of classifing images of cats and dogs
    accurately and efficiently.
