This package is a `sparklyr` extension containing all required MVN dependencies
and train+test data sets for a `sparklyr` image classification demo.

The goal of this demo is to leverage Apache Spark and Inception V3 (a pre-
trained convolutional neural network for image analysis tasks) to build a
scalable Spark ML pipeline capable of classifing images of cats and dogs
accurately and efficiently.

The author of this package wishes to acknowledge that the abovementioned `sparklyr`
image classification demo benefited greatly from the availability of the
[spark-deep-learning](https://spark-packages.org/package/databricks/spark-deep-learning)
library (an open-source Scala library developed by [Databricks](https://databricks.com/)
implementing Inception-V3 and other sophisticated image feature extractors) and the
[dogs-vs-cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) image data set (hosted by
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)).
